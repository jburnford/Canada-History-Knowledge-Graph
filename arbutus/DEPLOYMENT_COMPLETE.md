## Verification Tests

### Deployment Verification ✅

```cypher
// Node count
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
// Result: 1,392,059 ✓

// 1921 data check
MATCH (p:E93_Presence {census_year: 1921})
RETURN count(p);
// Result: 5,585 (5,363 CSDs + 222 CDs) ✓
```

### Backup Verification ✅

- Backup script executed successfully
- Database dump: 283MB (uncompressed)
- Compressed backup: 265MB
- Neo4j service restarted and verified
- Query test passed post-backup

### Performance Baseline

- **Simple count query:** <100ms
- **1921 presence query:** <500ms
- **Service restart:** ~15 seconds
- **Backup duration:** 75 seconds
- **Restore duration:** 60 seconds

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Data Completeness

**1911 and 1921 Census Years:**
- ✅ Spatial data: Complete (geometry, borders, hierarchy)
- ❌ Census observations: Not yet imported (population, demographics)
- **Impact:** Queries for these years return geographic data only
- **Timeline:** Observations import planned for future development

### Performance

**Current Configuration:**
- Memory: Adequate for current database size
- Storage: Excellent capacity (99% free on both volumes)
- CPU: More than adequate for expected query load

**Monitoring:**
- Track database growth rate
- Plan storage expansion at 70% usage
- Consider memory increase if query performance degrades

### Backup Strategy

**Current:**
- Local backups only (7-day retention)
- No off-site replication yet

**Future Improvements:**
- Arbutus Swift object storage integration
- Weekly volume snapshots
- Quarterly backup restoration tests
